# Matrix Search & Sort (C++)
This C++ program generates a random 2D matrix based on user-defined dimensions and value range, searches for a target value, and displays all matching coordinates. If the value exists, the program sorts the matrix values in ascending and descending order by flattening the matrix into a 1D vector, applying bubble sort, and rebuilding the 2D structure.

## Tech used
- C++
- `std::vector`
- Functions, loops, and conditionals
- Basic searching and sorting (linear search, bubble sort)

## What I practiced
- Working with 2D data structures
- Algorithmic thinking (search + sort)
- Console input/output formatting

> Academic exercise focused on reinforcing C++ fundamentals.
